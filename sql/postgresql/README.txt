Best effort was done to assure the integrety of this data from the presented source.

But I'm human, so its possible I made a mistake.

I had 2 data dumps and I chose to process only the most recent one, hence '2'.


Dirs:
./all/ - Contains a giant raw SQL Dump to import.
./schema/ - Contains the SQL data for the schema of the tables so data can then be imported.
./data/ - Contains the SQL data to import after the ./schema/ directory is imported.

I had only CSV files so I did this in steps to assure validation etc.  

This is why you get a nice raw pSQL Dump file of what I had to build bit by bit.

You are welcome.
